1. Security considerations:

The entire infrastructure is encapsulated into a VPC; all Internet traffic goes through:

VPCInternetGateway: gateway to Internet for VPC components (PublicSubnet*).

There are two main Security Groups which separate the internetfacing parts of the architecture, meaning the webservers(and associated components), from the private parts, meaning the database cluster mainly.
PublicSecurityGroup: HTTP/HTTPS/SSH access permitted from outside.

PrivateSecurityGroup: Database, access permitted only from web stack to DB stack.

There are two Subnets associated with each group (in distinct availability zones):

PublicSubnetA/B: web servers stack, the subnets are publicly accessible.

HiddenSubnetA/B: database stack, the subnets are not publicly accessible.

The routing for these subnets is as follows:

PublicRouteTable: opens traffic from the public subnets to the Internet.

HiddenRouteTable: ensures privacy for the private subnets.

Currently the private subnets have no access to the outside world (saw no point yet).

2. Scalability considerations

Web Cluster: the web servers are governed by an AutoScalingGroup and sit under an ElasicLoadBalancer instance for loadbalancing and faulttolerance.

Vertical scaling: web servers can be upgraded to larger memory/compute/storage capacities without downtime.

Horizontal scaling: The AutoScalingGroup implements policies for scaling up or down based on CPU usage metrics of the nodes (implemented via CloudWatch Alarms).

Database Cluster: The RDS Aurora cluster has a master (writer) instance and also a read replica at this time.

Vertical scaling: instances can be upgraded to larger memory/compute/storage capacities without downtime.

Horizontal scaling: up to 15 read replicas can be added without downtime; to scale write operations partitioning would
be an option.

Networking infrastructure: All networking components such as ELBs, ASGs, InternetGateway, VPC Router (and probably many more) are scaledout by the AWS ecosystem.

3. Availability Considerations:

Web Cluster: Both the ASG and ELB instances which govern the web servers currently span over two Availability Zones (although probably all should be used).

Database Cluster: The RDS Aurora deployment has better failover behavior (less downtime) than an analogous installation of ELB + RDS/MySQL instances; although downtime is still possible (in some cases of failover), it is much less likely
(usually 100 200seconds).

DDoS by attack or failure: I tried as much as possible to avoid any SPoFs (singlepointoffailure) to keep this infrastructure robust and my intent was that DDoS attacks would either: be avoided; mostly by encapsulation (VPC, subnets, traffic rules etc.) or...
translate to high loads which AWS can take without experiencing service outage; obviously this is still bad, but manageable.

4. Monitoring and Alerts:

The ELB for the web servers commits logs into an S3 Bucket (every 5 minutes).

Following CloudWatch alarms are defined:

Scaling up alarm: send email on ASG events (when CPU usage is over 90%).

Scaling down alarm: send email on ASG events (when CPU usage is under 50%).

Billing alarm: send email when costs exceed a threshold USD amount (1000).

Alarms will notify the "OperationalEMail" address when triggered.
